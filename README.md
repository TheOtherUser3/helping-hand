# Helping Hand

## Overview
**Helping Hand** is a home management app designed to make everyday organization effortless. Whether you live alone, with roommates, or manage a full household, Helping Hand provides a simple way to track, plan, and maintain all aspects of home life — from shopping lists to cleaning reminders and bills.

The goal of Helping Hand is to take the stress out of home management by keeping everything in one convenient, organized hub.

## Target Users
Helping Hand is built for:
- Homeowners and renters of any kind
- Individuals, roommates, or families
- Anyone who wants an easier way to manage recurring household tasks and information

While users with larger homes or households may get even more use from it, the app is designed to benefit anyone managing a living space.

## Core Features
### 1. **Food Management**
- **Shopping List:** Keep a dynamic shopping list that you can easily add to using text, voice, or barcode scanning.
- **Meal Recommendations:** Get recipe ideas based on ingredients you already have or items on your shopping list. Uses an API call to pull meal data.

### 2. **Cleaning Reminders**
- Track cyclical and deep-cleaning tasks such as maintaining the shower, oven, or refrigerator.
- Stay on top of regular cleaning cycles and infrequent deep cleans with smart reminders.

### 3. **Bill Reminders**
- Receive alerts for upcoming bills and payment deadlines.
- View at-a-glance summaries like “Your $2,400 rent is due in 4 days.”

### 4. **Appointments**
- Store all appointments, dates, and related information in one place.
- Save phone numbers for appointments without cluttering your contact list.

### 5. **(Stretch Goal) Inventory Tracking**
- Automatically track frequently used household items.
- The app learns your usage patterns over time and reminds you to restock essentials (like paper towels or disinfectant wipes).
- These items can be automatically added to your shopping list once usage habits are established.

## Sensors and API Integration
- **Barcode Scanner:** Add products directly by scanning barcodes.
- **Voice Input:** Use speech-to-text to add shopping items easily.
- **Meal API:** Retrieve recipe suggestions based on ingredients.

## App Structure
Helping Hand is organized around a **central hub** with four (or five, if stretch goal is achieved) main widgets:

1. **Food Widget** — links to both the Meals and Shopping List pages.  
2. **Cleaning Reminder Widget** — manages all cleaning cycles.  
3. **Bill Reminder Widget** — tracks bill due dates and amounts.  
4. **Appointments Widget** — organizes appointments and related info.  
5. **(Stretch Goal) Inventory Widget** — handles automatic item tracking.

Each widget connects to its own page, with a return button leading back to the central hub. The hub shows a brief summary of key data for each area, so users can see what’s urgent at a glance.

Example summaries:
- “Your $2,400 rent is due in 4 days.”
- “You have 24 items on your shopping list.”

## Conclusion
Helping Hand is more than an app — it’s a personal home assistant that brings order to the chaos of daily life. By centralizing all essential household management tools into one streamlined experience, Helping Hand gives users the clarity to stay organized and stress-free.

Keeping your home in order shouldn’t feel like a full-time job — everyone could use a **Helping Hand**.
